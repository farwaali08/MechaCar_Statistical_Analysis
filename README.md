# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis ðŸš™

## OVERVIEW

This project utilizes R to complete a statistical review of production data for an automotive company. The ultimate goal is to be able to provide actionable insights that may help improve the design of a troubled prototype.

The main objectives include the following:

* Identifying the variables that best predict the prototype's fuel economy (in mpg)
* Obtaining summary statistics on the PSI (pounds per square inch) of the suspension coils
* Determining if manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

A proposal has also been prepared to conduct an additional study that compares the performance of the prototype against vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

A multiple regression analysis was used to predict which of the below variables are most likely to contribute a non-random amount of variance to the fuel economy (mpg). The `Pr(>|t|)` value represents the probability for each variable, and is accompanied by a significance code that indicates the significance level.

* `Vehicle Length` and `Ground Clearance`, with p-values of 2.6x10<sup>-12</sup> and 5.21x10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively, are the most statistically significant, and are the most likely to contribute a non-random amount of variance to the dataset. The intercept is also statistically significant, however that is not meaningful to this analysis.
* **The slope of the linear model not considered to be zero.** The p-value of the linear model (5.35X10<sup>-11</sup>) is much smaller than the value for an "extreme" level of significance, which provides sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>).
* **This model is fairly effective at predicting fuel economy for prototypees.** The r-squared value (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.7149) indicates that roughly 71.5% of the variation in the mpg dataset can be explained by the input variables. Although it can be improved, it is fairly efficient.
